I would want to be in a position where I could learn from my coworkers.

I would want to be in a similar position where I was surrounded by potential teachers. Finally, I would want a job that allowed for creativity.

I think working in a museum would be a great way to experience a different career option in my field. I am not sure exactly what I want to do with archaeology, so I'm really interested in exploring new possibilities, like museum work. As a child, I loved natural history museums and still think they are incredibly interesting. Also, most large museums are located in big cities, like those in LA, San Francisco, and D.C., so I would be surrounded by other cultural and artistic centers. I also like routines and schedules, and I think museum work would have a pretty predictable routine, while still being exciting because of the interesting topics and materials I would be dealing with on a daily basis.

As a child, I was deeply entranced by human animal relationships.  My sister, who suffers from Asperger’s, was not able to make personal relationships easily and struggled severely in social settings. At school, I would push her to communicate, but the walls stayed up, only to be broken when we got back home and she melted into the pudgy golden fat rolls of our dog Max.  The only time she felt a sense of companionship was when she was with that golden-coated mutt.  Watching my sister feel a social connection because of her dog compelled me to find my own connection with animals and the world around them and me.  When I reached the age of earning my own dog, an even messier mutt named Ruby, I was ready to spend every minute with her.  I find my deepest joy when her and I master a new trick, and find my deepest sorrow when I realize I will be living without her this upcoming year. In my opinion, people greatly underestimate the power of human-animal connections.  I have discovered so much about myself through my connections with animals and I want to give that incredible discovery to those around me.  Animals are deeply underestimated and their ability to alter human attitude and happiness is incomparable to any other force. Hopefully a deeper knowledge of animal behavior could lead to better treatment of animals both in commercial and laboratorial settings.  Although I have gotten first hand experience with as many animals as possible, I have never had the opportunity to actually learn the science behind animal behavior.  The fact that animal behavioral courses are even offered excites me greatly. I am in the right place to expand both my interest and my knowledge. Due to this, I would love an internship working with behavioral scientists or working on animal research.",1,12,2,7,5,4,3,8,9,10,6,11,4,4,4,4,4,3,2,4,4,4,2,,"Stanford, California, Santa Clara County",NA,Working on Spanish,1,Scotland,"Stanford, California, Santa Clara County","Germany, unclear","Transylvania, Romania","Ohio, unclear",Unclear,Unclear,White,White,2,6,6,9,9,10,9,10,10,4,5,3,3,2,3,3,4,2,3,5,4,5,5,5,4,3,2,4,4,4,3,3,1,1,1,1,1,4,3,3,4,4,1,1,1,1,8,2,4,5,6,7,10,3,9

I do recognize that this is not an extremely lucrative career, but since I am a college freshman and not overly concerned about money yet, I'd love to have this experience and learn more about the film industry. I was actually a bit turned off by the film industry during my last internship, but I believe being in a different position (i.e. director) in another project might change my perspective.

Secondly, I know that if I worked in criminal or civil law, I would never be able to defend the guilty or prosecute the innocent. I know that in those fields of law I would identify and feel more personally involved in the cases, and thus could not effectively do my job. In an ideal world, I would also have enough time to commit to community service, because it reminds me of what is important in the real world.
